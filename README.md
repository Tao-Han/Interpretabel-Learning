   - Materials

     *Some related learning materials*

   - Tags

     *I would like to tag these proposed methods with these notations*

     - auxillary-model : Interprete a complex model with an interpretable one
     - self-interprete : Design an self-interpretable structure on a complex model
     - human experiment
     - proxy metrics
     - feature based
     - instance based

# Interpretabel Machine Learning

1. This page provides some learning materials and notes for Interpretable Machine Learning and I would like to share my personal opinions on some papers.

2. The repository is organized as follows:

   - [Introduction](https://github.com/Tao-Han/Interpretabel-Learning/tree/master/Intruduction.md)
     discussion about the definition, intuition, motivation, evaluation

   - [Notes](https://github.com/Tao-Han/Interpretabel-Learning/tree/master/Notes), Here are my notes and understanding during reading these papers in chronological order.

   - Tags, I would like to tag these proposed methods with these notations:

     - auxillary-model : Interprete a complex model with an interpretable one
     - self-interprete : Design an self-interpretable structure on a complex model
     - human-experiment : 

   - Materials, Some related learning materials

3. Any discussion and advice is welcome and many thanks.

1. [Feb 2018: Explanations based on the Missing: Towards Contrastive Explanations with Pertinent Negatives(NIPS2018)](http://cn.arxiv.org/abs/1802.07623)

- **Motivation**
  - Many existed works pay little attention to the absent features, which are as important as the present ones.
  - Explain the prediction of model by answering what factor is present and what is absent.
  - To realize this idea, show the contrastive facts (features and class).
- **Model**
  - Definition
    - Pertinent Positive (**PP**): present factor minimally sufficient to get the final classification.
    - Pertinent Negative (**PN**): absent factor necessary to assert the final classification.
  - Contrastive Explanation Method (**CEM**)
    - Find PN
      1. Perturb instance by adding the absent features
      2. Minimize the loss of not changing prediction, instance reconstruction and structure risk.
    - Find PP
      1. Perturb instance by removing the present features
      2. Minimize the loss of not changing prediction, instance reconstruction and structure risk.
- **Evaluation**
  - The experiments include MNIST, fraud prediction and fMRI.
  - The evaluation is through visualization comparison and expert feedback.
- **Notes**
  - The motivation is convincible: decision comes from comparison.
  - I think take absence as a new feature adding into dataset then traditional models may achieve similar result.
  - The loss may associate with **Large Margin Loss**. Larger the class margin, better may the model be.

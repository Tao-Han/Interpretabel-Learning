1. [Jul 2018: Supervised Local Modeling for Interpretability (NIPS2018)](http://cn.arxiv.org/abs/1807.02910)

- **Motivation**
  - **Example-based**, local and **global** explanations are the three most common types of explanation system, having their own strengths and weaknesses in different contexts.
  - **SLIM** is a supervised local neighborhood approach assigning weights to training points called local training distribution.
  - SLIM combined the idea of sparse linear model and ensemble trees, holding properties including **high accuracy**, **global pattern detection** and **exemplar explanation**. 
- **Model**
  - Using random forests for supervised neighborhood selection for local linear model (**SILO**) and doing feature selection via the **DStump**.
  - Neighborhood is defined as instances in the same leaf node in forest.(**SILO**)
  - Feature importance is defined as the reduction of impurity of labels when the feature get split on the root of the trees.(**DStump**)

- **Explanation**
  - Explain a prediction: the coefficients of local linear model reflect the local effect of each feature.
  - Diagnose global patterns from local explanation: visualize the distribution of each feature or do grid search. (Not very detailed)
  - exemplar exlanation

- **Evaluation**
  - High accuracy avoids the trade-off between interpretation and performance
  - Faithful self-explanation
  - Accurate black-box predictive model
  - Local distribution for global pattern detection

***Local linear model + Neighborhood sampling + LASSO for feature selection = LIME;***

***Local linear model +  RF for neighborhood selection + RF for feature selection = SLIM***

2. [May 2017: A Unified Approach to Interpreting Model Predictions (NIPS2017)](http://cn.arxiv.org/abs/1705.07874)

- **Motivation**

  - Various explanation models are proposed but not organized well
  - A class of interpretable models can be unified into one framework

- **Model**

  - **Linear Feature Attribution Model**:
    $$
    f(x) \approx g(z)= \phi_0 + \sum_{i=1}^M\phi_iz_i, z\in \{0,1\}^M \\
    x = h(z)
    $$



  - **Desirable Properties**

    | Local Accuracy |         Missingness          |                         Consistency                          |
    | :------------: | :--------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
    |  $f(x)=g(z)$   | $z_i=0\Rightarrow \phi_i=0 $ | $f^1_x(z)-f^1_x(z\backslash i)\le f^2_x(z)-f^2_x(z\backslash i)\\\Rightarrow \phi^1_i\le\phi^2_i$ |

    The three properties will derive only one possible solution of $\phi_i$,which is **Shapley Value**

  - **Models in Framework**

    |       Model        |    Modification    |
    | :----------------: | :----------------: |
    |        LIME        | Kernel SHAP + LIME |
    |      DeepLIFT      |      DeepSHAP      |
    | Linear Coeficiency |     LinearSHAP     |
    |        ...         |        ...         |

- **Comments**

  - Unified framework with clear theory guide
  - Give the optimal solution of **Linear Feature Attribution Explanation direction**
  - The **Properties** may need some discussion
